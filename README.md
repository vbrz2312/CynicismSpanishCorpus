# CynicismSpanishCorpus
Cynical Expression Corpus for Spanish Language

The corpus was generated from YouTube comments downloaded from new car analysis channels. The comments were filtered, taking into account two requirements: comments must contain at least ten words, and comments must have a minimum of 5 likes. 

The goals of these constraints were to ensure sufficient text to judge the presence or absence of cynical expressions, and to focus on comments deemed to be relevant to the discussion.The result was a total of 3189 comments. Two annotators were given a set of annotator guidelines containing examples of each type of cynical expression. One of the annotators was a masterâ€™s student in computer science, and the second was a university teacher in computer science. 

The annotation guidelines had three sections: an introduction to the topic of consumer cynicism,examples of each type of cynical expression, and examples of what the annotation should look like using different colors to mark the text. The annotators were also given a description of the context of the research and a video tutorial on how to use the annotation tool. A group of 50 pre-training comments was used to familiarize the annotators with the annotation task. To calculate agreement between annotators, we counted two annotations as matching if the text segment of one annotator was contained within the segment the other annotator.
